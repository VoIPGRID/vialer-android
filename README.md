# Vialer Android

Vialer is an Android application that serves as both a VoIP client and a management tool for accounts on the [VoIPGRID](https://voipgrid.nl) platform.

## Open-source

Vialer is designed exclusively for use with VoIPGRID, this repository exists so that our development of the product is open and publicly visible rather than because we want to encourage collaboration.

There are no plans to modify this repository to support other VoIP providers or technologies that aren't relevant to VoIPGRID, if you wish to do so then we would encourage you to fork the repository.

We do have plans to create a provider-independent Android wrapper around the PJSIP library, this would be similar to [VialerSIPLib](https://github.com/VoIPGRID/VialerSIPLib) which was created for iOS. However we do not have an estimate for when we expect this to be ready.

## Issues

For support, bug reports or feature requests, please contact your telecom provider.
